# MMath-Project-CL
Code to handle and plot simulation data for MMath project "Regimes of Magnetic Reconnection"

- Commits from 'Alex Russel and Conan Liptrott' are commits that I (Conan Liptrott) did from a shared server and have no affiliation with Alex Russell.
- I intend to use the repository to continue investigating these regimes post-project submission. Commits that are added after the project deadline on the 12th of April will be marked PS for Post Submission.
